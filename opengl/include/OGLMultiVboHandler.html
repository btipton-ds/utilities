    <h1>Summary of Batched VBO Rendering</h1>
    <p>
        This architecture was created in response to <a href="https://3dsystems.atlassian.net/browse/GF-10849">GF-10849</a> which reported extremely slow rendering on
        models with thousands of patches. That lead to epic <a href="https://3dsystems.atlassian.net/browse/GF-11112">GF-11112</a> which covers all the work required. From
        an outside view, this seems an incredibly large response to a small problem. To understand why, it's important to understand that in a worst case it took over 180 seconds to render
        a single frame of the file in <a href="https://3dsystems.atlassian.net/browse/GF-10849">GF-10849</a> and that file is a fairly typical output of the ADP autosurfacer. From a user perspective, FreeForm would hang when opening
        autosurfacer files of medium, or greater, size.
    </p>
    <p>
        The justification for this effort is in the resulting frame rate. This approach moved the average framerate for drawing large patch models from 1 fps or less to about 60 fps.
        In the best (worst?) case it achieved a 1,200 X increase in frame rate.
    </p>
    <p>There was also feedback from customers that FreeForm's rendering didn't take advantage of their new graphics card's high performance features.</p>
    <p>This approach may be applicable to other areas of rendering, like clay.</p>
    <p>
        The multi version supports one set of vertex, normal, texture, color buffers and multiple index VBOs referencing them.
        These arrays are divided, based on size, into "batches." The CAD industry breaks them up by face, but that's too slow. The gaming folks
        use single arrays - that's resulted in segment faults and they are extremely hard to manage because to change one face we have to reconstruct
        the "world." This approach is documented online as Batched VBOs and that's how we're referring to this.
    </p>
    <p>Keeping track of units (byte, float, vertex-3, vertex-2, vertex-1, triangle etc.) can be confusing. I've attempted to include the unit type in the variable names, such as vertBaseIndex, 
    to avoid confusion with byteBaseIndex or floatBaseIndex. It makes the code more verbose, but avoids have to constantly check comments and declarations.</p>
    <p>
        Fit colors use vertex colors, pull dir colors use front and back vertex colors and face textures us UV/texture mapping.
    </p>
    <p>
        All of this data is preloaded in a set of buffers, managed by FaceVisual and EdgeVisual.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is based on the timing concept that the number of changes is always less than the number of draw calls. At 60 fps, a user will have to modifiy data
        faster than 60 fps to violate that assumption. In many cases we're changing at less than 1 fps.
    </p>
    <p>
        As an example:
    </p>
    <p>
        Solid faces, patch faces, fit faces, selected faces and hilighted faces all draw with different colors. Fit to clay uses vertex colors, but only those
        with a fit. Pull direction uses front and back vertex colors, which must be draw seperately. Face texture mapping uses uv values and a set of textures
        which cannot all be active at once.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, we have a map of draw keys. The number of keys is totally adjustable, but should be kept relatively small.
    </p>
    <p>
        The draw loop looks like
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>for each batch</li>
            <li>&nbsp;bind common buffers for all draw calls</li>
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;for each populated key</li>
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setup appropriate color and draw settings via preDrawFunc</li>
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;draw element index buffer</li>
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clean up color and draw settings via postDrawFunc</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        Since the vertices, normals and uvs are common for all draw calls, they are all bound during each batch's bindCommon call. These buffers stay bound for the
        entire key loop. Curren
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently the vertex color buffers are bound when each key is drawn. It may be possible to bind these at the same time as the other buffers, but pull direction
        drawing poses trouble. Pull direction drawing uses different colors for front faces than back faces and requires a buffer swap. Right new we swap the color buffers
        every key whether it's required or not. It's simpler and safer that way.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, the number of draw calls is small, but not the minimum possible
    </p>
    <h2>Triggering a Screen Refresh</h2>
    <p>
        While this approach is designed to be independent of the Surface Modeling layer, it was also designed to work specifically with it. So, to trigger regeneration
        of the keys and index buffers call either
    </p>
    <p>
        BreMode::setBrepRenderNeedsUpdate() or send a BrepDisplayChangedEvent which will call it for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the next draw pass, the FaceVisual predraw method will test the flag and do what's required. It's probably advisable to improve this approach instead of adding a new one.
        If this method is ever extended to drawing mesh or clay, a similar method for triggering updates should be created.

    <h2>
        Reuse of graphics memory
    </h2>
    <p>
        The memory on the graphics card is limited. If memory is fully deleted frequently and only a portion is used, memory management is easy. When the buffer sizes
        are small, there are lots of buffers and much of the memory is used - it requires reallocation of the memory. It's like a problem in heap management. TBD
    </p>
    <h2>
        Structure
    </h2>
    <p>
        On the OGL side, there is no knowledge or assumption of faces, edges or vertices. That organization is created by the BrepModel architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Data is duplicated between main memory and the graphics card. This allows us to modify main memory and transfer to the card without rebuilding</li>
            <li>Data on the card is stored by BufferId. It's an unsigned int which behaves like a pointer to memory on the card</li>
            <li>All drawing is done using glDrawElements by element indices</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>ElementVBORec</h3>
    <p>
        This structure holds the data required for a call to glDrawElements. It's members are the number of elements to draw and the buffer id for the elements.
    </p>
    <p>
        It containts the element ids to render a group of graphics entities (lines and triangles) which should be drawn with the same properties. For example, all selected faces will be drawn by the
        DRAW_PHASE_SELECTED key. If that key is not specific enough, a new key must be created to cover the case. The number of keys is not bounded and managed in an stl::map.
        Keys are simple ints. It is up to the API user to assure that keys are not ambiguous. Surfacing::Face does this with an enum defined in the .cpp file. It's in the cpp
        file to prevent a large rebuild everytime a key is modified.
    </p>
    <h3>Keys and Key Map</h3>
    <p>
        Keys are keys into an stl map of ElementVBORecs. Keys are unique within a batch, but may be duplicated across batches.
    </p>
    <p>Keys are stored in a key map.</p>
    <h3>Batches | VertexBatch</h3>
    <p>
        A batch is an entire set of VBOs which can draw a subset of the model's elements. There is an unresolvable conflict between the CAD editor's need to interactively edit
        or regenerate each face, edge or vertex and the renderer's need to use as few draw calls as possible. The CAD industry uses a set of VBOs for every face while the
        game industry uses one set of VBOs for an entire model, character or scene.
    </p>
    <p>
        Batching is the term I found in use in internet articles on the best compromise solution. It lumps the soup of faces into groups called batches and there's an arbitrary
        limit on how large the group can get. That group is a stored in a VertexBatch.
    </p>
    <p>Each batch holds a set of VBOs (vertex, normal, tex coords, front colors, back colors etc.) required to draw the batch.</p>
    <p>The batches are stored in a std::vector<shared_ptr<VertexBatch>> so that addition, removal or restructuring of the list is only a pointer assignment.</p>
    <p>The face maintains an OGLIndices structure (see that section) so that each face can still be drawn individually, using the graphics data stored in its batch.</p>
    <p>There is relationship where each batch contains many faces/edges/vertics and one face/edge/vertex points to entries in a single batch.</p>
    <p>Ideally, it will also be possible to recreate only the batches required.</p>
    <p>
        To make updating of each batch faster, the contents of each VBO (vertex, normal etc.) are kept in main memory. When the contents change, the effected values are
        overwritten and the entire batch is sent back to the graphics card's VBO memory.
    </p>
    <p><b>TODO:</b> A future enhancement may be to support partial writing of only the changed values.</p>
    <h3>
        FaceVisual::updateBatchVBOIndices
    </h3>
    <p>
        The complexity shows up in setting up the batches, keys and maps.
        That's where FaceVisual::updateBatchVBOIndices function comes into play.
    </p>
    <p>
        The downside is that every time selection or highlighting changes, updateBatchVBOIndices must be called. This is accelerated with a set of dirty flags on each face/edge/vertex.
        There's a loop which runs the face list and decides which key it requires and puts the appropriate elements in that key's element list. This is reasonably fast because
        it's just the element indices that are updated and only for the effected batches.
    </p>
    <p>
        This function must be called every time the draw state changes. If not, the display will be incorrect.
        It runs the face loop, the batch for each face is fetched (it's store with the face), and the face's indices are placed under the appropriate key
        in the face's batch. This can be further optimized by change tracking on a per face basis, so only the changed batches are updated.
    </p>
    <p>
        During updateBatchVBOIndices the elements needed for each draw phase (solid, selcted, vertex colors etc.) are added to the batch's key to element map. During drawing
        the the element index VBO in each batch is draw for each key. To accelerate further, thee keys which contain elements are added to a simple linear array.
        The drawAllKeys method runs a loop, only for the active keys, thus avoiding all testing, setup etc. Adding this method moved the draw rate from 25-30 fps to 60-70 fps.
        That performance improvement justifies the complexity.
    </p>
    <h3>COglMultiVboHandler::OGLIndices</h3>
    <p>
        The OGLIndices structure contains all the information required to render a single face/edge/vertex. It contains a point to the batch containing all of the data
        needed to render a complete entity such as a face/edge/vertex. It is implicit in the architecture that a face/edge/vertex cannot be split across batches.
    </p>
    <h3>Vertex Color Rendering</h3>
    <p>
        It is required that all entities with vertex colors must have their vertex color values in their batch. As a result, all other entries in the color VBO must be present,
        but they may contain 0s. There is support for both front and back colors for each vertex to support parting line colors. When using the VERTEX_COLOR_FRONT key, only the
        indices using vertex colors will be drawn, only the populated colors will be used and the zero colors will never be read. It's not memory efficient, but it's very fast.
    </p>
    <h3>Texture Rendering</h3>
    <p>
        Open GL has no support for a texture lookup array. This results in each face/edge/vertex requiring a setting of the correct textures. The only way I could find around this
        is to create a 'macro' texture and remapping each faces' uv values into that macro texture. <b>This has not been done, and I doubt it will ever be worth the effort for Freeform.</b>
    </p>
    <h2>Misc</h2>
    <p>
        This is a work in progress as of 12/9/2022, vertex colors and face textures in particular.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is used as
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>copyToVBO(...)</li>
            <li>addIndexVBO(indices0)</li>
            <li>addIndexVBO(indices1)</li>
            <li>addIndexVBO(indices2)</li>


            <li>// Set colors etc</li>
            <li>draw(0);</li>
            <li>// Set colors etc</li>
            <li>draw(1);</li>
            <li>// Set colors etc</li>
            <li>draw(2);</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    Each draw corresponds to color state such as normal, selected, high lighted, mirrored, instanced etc.
